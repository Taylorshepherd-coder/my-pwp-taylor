	Lindsey Smith is a 30 year old, single female. She just recently finished her nursing program and was hired at the local hospital. She spends most of her time at work, seeing she works 12 hour days, 4 days a week. But when she is not at work, she is either watching movies at home or spending time outdoors. She spends most of her time outside of work alone and is looking to expand her home life by getting a dog to keep her company. She thinks she is interested in a Shar-Pei, purely based on their adorable looks, but wants to do more research on them to find out if a Shar-Pei would be a good fit for her and her lifestyle. Although dogs are her favorite animal, she has actually never owned one so she wants to do as much research she can to educate herself so she can go above and beyond caring for her dog. She uses her iPhone 10s while she is on the go, but when she is at home she mostly uses her Dell laptop; where she will most likely being doing the majority of her research.
